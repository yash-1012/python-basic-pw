        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**  \n",
        "   - Combines data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).\n",
        "   - Protects data by restricting direct access to it and providing controlled access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**  \n",
        "   - Focuses on essential features of an object and hides complex implementation details.\n",
        "   - Allows developers to work with higher-level interfaces without worrying about internal mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**  \n",
        "   - Enables a class (child or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or base class).\n",
        "   - Promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**  \n",
        "   - Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even when they belong to a derived class.\n",
        "   - Supports method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Class and Object**  \n",
        "   - **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects, defining the structure and behavior.\n",
        "   - **Object**: An instance of a class, representing a real-world entity with specific attributes and behaviors."

        "### **What is Method Resolution Order (MRO)?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** in Python is the order in which Python looks for a method or attribute in a class hierarchy during inheritance. It determines the sequence of classes that are searched to resolve a method or attribute reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses the **C3 linearization (or C3 superclass linearization)** algorithm to compute the MRO for classes. This ensures a consistent and predictable order for method resolution in complex inheritance hierarchies, especially when multiple inheritance is involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Points About MRO**\n",
        "1. MRO starts searching from the current class, then its parents, following the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "2. In the case of multiple inheritance, it ensures a left-to-right search as specified in the class definition.\n",
        "3. MRO prevents circular inheritance issues and ambiguity.\n",

        "2. Use the **`mro()`** method of the class.\n",

        "1. **`measure_time` Decorator**:\n",
        "   - The `measure_time` function is a decorator that takes a function `func` as input and returns a wrapped version of it.\n",

        "\n",

        "   - The start time is recorded before the function call.\n",
        "   - The function is executed, and its result is stored.\n",
        "   - The end time is recorded after the function call.\n",
        "   - The execution time is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n",
        "   - The execution time is printed in seconds with six decimal precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Usage**:\n",
        "   - Apply the decorator to any function using the `@measure_time` syntax.\n",
        "   - When the decorated function is called, the decorator automatically logs the execution time."
